# Statistics for Bioinformatics

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of resources and scripts focusing on the application of probability and statistics in bioinformatics, with a specific emphasis on the analysis of microarray data. The included materials utilize the open-source R programming language for statistical computation. The key topics covered in this repository are as follows:

1. Maximum likelihood estimation
2. Monte Carlo simulations in bioinformatics
3. Adjustment for false discovery rate
4. Implementation of nonparametric methods, including bootstrap and permutation tests
5. Correlation analysis and regression techniques in bioinformatics
6. Application of ANOVA and generalized linear models in bioinformatics
7. Preprocessing techniques for microarray data and gene filtering
8. Visualization methods for multivariate data in bioinformatics
9.Introduction to machine-learning techniques, such as clustering, principal components analysis, support vector machines, neural networks, and regression trees in bioinformatics.
